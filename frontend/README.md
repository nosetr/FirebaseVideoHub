# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

## Start a new Expo project with Bun

To create a new project, run the command:

```bash
bun create expo my-app
```

To run your project, navigate to the directory and run one of the following bun commands.

```bash
cd frontend
bun run start
bun run android
bun run ios # you need to use macOS to build the iOS project - use the Expo app if you need to do iOS development without a Mac
bun run web
```

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
bun run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

To install any Expo library, you can use bun expo install:

```bash
bun expo install expo-av
```
